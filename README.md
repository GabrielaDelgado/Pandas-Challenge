# Pandas-Challenge
Challenge 4

Contributor: Gabriela Delgado

Overview

This project was meant to look at public schools' data using Jupyter Notebook to look into the type of school, the number of students, the budget of the school and students, and the students' results in standardized tests. Then create summary tables for easier readability.

This Challenge contains a ReadMe file, the data sets, my code using Jupyter Notebook, and a document with my analysis of the data

Git Bash

I used GitBash to download the repository to my desktop and push and commit the changes made to the Python code into the repository

VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

I used VS Code to be able to read the CSV files with the data to be analyzed. I imported the pandas and pathlib to be able to work with these datasets. First, I used functions to count the number of schools and students in the data set. Then, I looked into the average math and reading scores and percentages of the students by test type and as overall. Later, I started grouping the results by school to be able to further analyze the effect of the differences in schools to be able to conclude the data gathered.
